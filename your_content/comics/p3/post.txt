We've put a lot of effort in to make the [Getting Started](https://github.com/ryanvilbrandt/comic_git/wiki/Getting-Started) process as straight forward as possible, with plenty of screenshots and examples. But if anything is at all unclear, please feel free to reach out for help [on our Discord](https://discord.gg/zmdHGXB), and we'll make sure to clarify things/help get you unstuck.
