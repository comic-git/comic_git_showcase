Adding new comic pages really is as simple as [copying files into a folder and updating some text files](https://comic-git.gitbook.io/documentation/basic-editing/adding-comic-pages).

If you want to change things like colors and fonts on your site, you just need to edit a [well-commented CSS file](https://github.com/ryanvilbrandt/comic_git_dev/blob/working/your_content/themes/default/css/stylesheet.css). comic_git also supports more advanced changes, like writing your own web pages from scratch or adding Javascript, via the use of [Themes](https://comic-git.gitbook.io/documentation/advanced-editing/themes).
